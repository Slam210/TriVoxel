# Problem
No website currently exists dedicated to the production of 3D Javascript development. Tutorials, documentation, and subreddits exist, but they must be more scattered to find information effectively. This problem can be solved by using this website, which serves as a hub for current and potential 3D Javascript developers.

# Description

The website aims to allow users to learn how 3d animations in JS work, hosting blogs and tutorials on creating 3d projects in JavaScript that allow the user to feel like they’re in the 3d perspective, rather than making an image that just looks 3d. Only admins can create tutorials and the process to become one will most likely be a form that must be manually approved. Each blog or tutorial will have a comment section to enable questions and room for growth. In addition to the blogs and tutorials, there will be an additional section that will host the main point of the website, a 3d resume builder. This builder will allow the user to select from a range of models, creating their resume in a 3d environment in real-time. There will be a user system to enable saving and viewing of the user’s 3d resumes as well as the resumes of others, with the ability to copy the design structure of another user. Comments and favorites will be built in, allowing the user to save posts, resumes, and comments they like so they can view them anytime.
